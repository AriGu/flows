12. Resellers.		
		
This Section 12 applies to you and your Authorized Users only if you are a Reseller. Reseller attests that Reseller has identified itself to Company as a Reseller and agrees that Reseller shall not send or receive messages on behalf of a Reseller Customer until approved to do so in writing by Company. Reseller attests that Reseller is authorized by each Reseller Customer to send and receive messages on behalf of each Reseller Customer, and that, where required by HIPAA or other regulation, Reseller has entered into a suitable Business Associate Agreement with each Reseller Customer that permits Reseller to send and receive messages containing Protected Health Information on behalf of each Reseller Customer through the System. Reseller and Company agree that it is the sole responsibility of Reseller to (a) deliver received data to Reseller Customer once Reseller acknowledges receipt of data through an approved interface to the System, (b) provide any accounting of Disclosures of Protected Health Information to Reseller Customers, (c) provide any accounting of other metrics or user-based auditing to Reseller Customers as may be required by Reseller Customer to meet obligations under applicable law, regulation, or other standard, and (d) if Reseller provides access to System to Reseller Customers through Reseller's application or interface, provide obvious visual indicators to alert Reseller Customers as to the potential access to Protected Health Information through such application or interface, and the privacy and security requirements of such access. Reseller agrees to protect the Codes of Reseller Customers, and to maintain an accounting of all Reseller Customers with access to Codes, including when access to Codes was established and terminated. Reseller further agrees that Reseller is solely responsible for authenticating each Reseller Customer using an authentication method approved by Company prior to accessing the System on Reseller Customer's behalf, that Reseller must maintain an accounting of which Authorized User has access to Codes or to the System at any given time sufficient to determine which Authorized User sent or retrieved a specific message through the System at a given time for all transactions where Authorized Users do not individually authenticate to the System at the user level, and to provide the name of the Authorized User associated with a specific transaction to Company upon Company’s request. Reseller will maintain such an accounting of access for the time periods required by HIPAA, HITECH, and other applicable laws. Reseller agrees that each Reseller Customer is an Authorized User of Reseller. Reseller agrees to enter into suitable contracts with each Reseller Customer that bind Reseller Customers to the terms of this Agreement, and that Reseller will make these contracts available to Company upon request. Reseller agrees not to access System on behalf of a Reseller Customer if such a contract is not in place, has expired, or has otherwise been terminated. Company may also require each Reseller Customer to enter into a separate phiMail Software License Agreement or other similar Agreement with Company prior to Reseller's use of System on behalf of that Reseller Customer. Reseller agrees to access System on behalf of Reseller Customers only through interfaces approved by Company, and further agrees not to provide direct access to the System interfaces to a Reseller Customer without written consent of Company. Reseller agrees that Reseller is responsible for all fees charged by Company related to System Use, certificate issuance, renewal, re-keying, or modification of a certificate issued by Company to a Reseller Customer at Reseller's request, and acknowledges that Reseller Customer certificates and Codes may be revoked by Company if fees are not paid. Company agrees that Reseller may charge or choose not to charge, as Reseller sees fit, fees to Reseller Customer for any use of the System by Reseller on Reseller Customer's behalf.		
		
13. Health Information Service Providers.		
		
This Section 13 applies to you and your Authorized Users only if you are a HISP. HISP shall appoint at least one Information Systems Security Officer (each an "ISSO" and, collectively, the "ISSOs"). HISP shall require each ISSO to perform all ISSO duties in accordance with this Agreement and the CP/CPS. Each ISSO will be approved by Company only after he or she has been successfully identity proofed by Company in accordance with the CP/CPS. HISP agrees that all private keys corresponding to any public key listed in a Certificate issued to HISP or to any end user or organization serviced by HISP (the "HISP Customers") shall be secured and managed exclusively by approved ISSOs, and shall never be provided to any other party. HISP shall require each HISP Customer to agree to the terms of this Agreement as a phiCert Subscriber, and to authorize HISP ISSOs to exclusively secure and manage private keys and certificates on behalf of the HISP Customer, such agreement and authorization to be made in writing and provided to Company at the time of application for a Certificate. HISP agrees that each ISSO shall restrict the use of private keys only to Authorized Users of the corresponding Certificate. HISP, HISP ISSOs, HISP Customers and their Authorized Users are phiCert Subscribers as defined in this agreement. All requests for issuance, renewal, modification, re-keying or revocation of certificates issued to HISP or HISP Customers must be made by an ISSO. HISP is solely responsible for any fees charged by Company in conjunction with any such request. HISP agrees to maintain an access control list for private keys corresponding to each certificate issued by Company and managed by HISP ISSOs, including an accounting of which Subscriber(s) had access to use each Private Key at any time and when such access was granted or terminated, and to provide the current access control list to Company within seven (7) days upon Company’s request. HISP ISSOs may delegate management of such access control list to a HISP Customer, but HISP is solely responsible for collecting any list managed by a HISP Customer when needed, ensuring the accuracy thereof, and submitting the list to Company within the seven (7) day time frame. HISP acknowledges, and will require any HISP Customer to whom list management is delegated to acknowledge, that failure to supply the information required is a violation of this Agreement and the CP/CPS and may result in immediate revocation of any associated Certificate.		
		
14. Fees and Refund Policy.		
		
All fees are due prior to the start of service and prior to any applicable annual renewal date. Certificates may be corrected prior to acceptance, as defined in Section 5, at no additional fee. After acceptance, refunds are not available. Fees will not be prorated for use for a period of less than a year or for any other circumstance. In the case of Excessive Use of the System by Subscriber or one of Subscriber's Authorized Users, Company, in its sole discretion, may limit access to System, require payment of additional fees by Subscriber as a condition of allowing ongoing Use, or terminate this Agreement. Additional fees will also apply for modification, re-keying or renewal of certificates issued by Company. A current fee schedule is available upon request from Company. Fees are subject to change without notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if this Agreement includes an attached fee schedule as Exhibit B, then the fee schedule in Exhibit B shall apply for the services included therein during the effective period specified therein, or for the 12 month period starting with the beginning of the term of this Agreement if Exhibit B does not specify an effective period.		
		
15. Business Associate Agreement.		
		
This Section 15 (the "BAA") applies to you and your Authorized Users only if you are a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber (the acceptance date of the associated Certificate by Subscriber is the beginning of the "BAA Term"), and, further this BAA applies only for the validity period of such Codes (the expiration date or revocation date of the associated Certificate, whichever is earlier, is the last day of the corresponding "BAA Term"). If you are not a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber and your subscription status is changed so that you become a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber, this BAA will apply to you during the time you are a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber; if you are a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber and your subscription status changed so that you are not a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber, this BAA will terminate. Notwithstanding the above, section 15C(ii)-(iii) shall apply to all Subscribers.		
		
A. Definitions. Catch-all definition: The following terms used in this BAA (or alternate forms or conjugations thereof) shall have the same meaning as those terms in the HIPAA Rules: Breach, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Protected Health Information, Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use. Specific definitions: "Company as Business Associate" shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" at 45 CFR 160.103, and in reference to the party to this agreement, shall mean Company, when Company meets the definition of Business Associate under HIPAA. "Covered Entity" shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" at 45 CFR 160.103, and in reference to the party to this agreement, shall mean a Subscriber who is a Covered Entity or a Business Associate and who is a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber. "HIPAA Rules" shall mean the Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rules at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164.		
		
B. Obligations and Activities of Company as Business Associate. Company as Business Associate agrees to: (i) not Use or Disclose Protected Health Information other than as permitted or required by this Agreement or as Required By Law; (ii) employ appropriate safeguards, and comply with Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic Protected Health Information, to prevent Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information other than as provided for by this Agreement; (iii) report to Covered Entity any Use or Disclosure of Protected Health Information not provided for by this Agreement of which it becomes aware, including Breaches of Unsecured Protected Health Information as required at 45 CFR 164.410, and any Security Incident of which it becomes aware; (iv) in accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii) and 164.308(b)(2), if applicable, ensure that any Subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit Protected Health Information on behalf of the Company as Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Company as Business Associate with respect to such information; (v) make available to Covered Entity the information required to assist Covered Entity in providing an accounting of Disclosures as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528; Specifically, Company as Business Associate will make available to Covered Entity through Company's approved interfaces status information relating to messages transmitted by Covered Entity, as specified in the Documentation. It is the sole responsibility of Covered Entity, however, to retrieve this information, to provide accounting of Protected Health Information disclosed by Covered Entity in each message sent by Covered Entity, including the recipient specified by the Covered Entity, the date of transmission, and the actual message contents and any Protected Health Information included in each message, and to update this accounting information as applicable with the status information made available by Company; (vi) to the extent the Company as Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 164, comply with the requirements of Subpart E that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and (vii) make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.		
		
C. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Company as Business Associate		
		
(i) Company as Business Associate may, in the course of troubleshooting system issues, encounter incidental occasional exposure to Protected Health Information, and may use this Protected Health Information for the purpose of troubleshooting the System. Covered Entity acknowledges that Company as Business Associate is agnostic as to the content of messages sent to and received by Covered Entity and serves merely as a conduit for transmission of Protected Health Information to and from Covered Entity, and that any temporary storage of Protected Health Information by Company as Business Associate in the process of sending and receiving messages is only incidental to such transmission. Covered Entity agrees that sending a message through an approved Company interface is a Disclosure of any included Protected Health Information by Covered Entity to the specified Recipient, and is not a Disclosure by Company as Business Associate to the Recipient.		
		
(ii) Company as Business Associate may use or disclose Protected Health Information as required by law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.		
		
(iii) Company as Business Associate agrees to make Uses and Disclosures and requests for Protected Health Information only as required to fulfill item (ii) immediately above.

Simultaneously with any termination of this BAA, Subscriber shall be deemed not a Hosted by EMR Direct Subscriber.		
		
(ii) Termination for Cause. Company as Business Associate authorizes termination of the BAA term by Covered Entity, if Covered Entity determines Company as Business Associate has violated a material term of this BAA and Company as Business Associate has not cured the breach or ended the violation within the time specified by Covered Entity, or, if longer, within five business days after notice to the Company through Company's secure website.		
		
(iii) Obligations of Company as Business Associate Upon Termination. Upon termination of this BAA for any reason, Company as Business Associate, with respect to Protected Health Information which may be in Covered Entity's account, shall: Retain only that Protected Health Information which is necessary for Company as Business Associate to continue its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities; Destroy the remaining Protected Health information that Company as Business Associate still maintains in any form; Continue to use appropriate safeguards and comply with subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic Protected Health Information to prevent Use or Disclosure of the Protected Health Information, other than as provided for in this Section, for as long as Company as Business Associate retains the Protected Health Information; Not Use or Disclose the Protected Health Information retained by Company as Business Associate other than as required by law; and Destroy the Protected Health Information retained by Company as Business Associate when it is no longer needed by Company as Business Associate for its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities.		
		
(iv) Survival. The obligations of Company as Business Associate under this Section shall survive the termination of this BAA.		
		
E. Miscellaneous. Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be interpreted to permit compliance with HIPAA, HITECH, and other rules and laws.		
		
16. Trusted Agents.		
		
If you are a phiCert Subscriber, you accept the role of "Trusted Agent" of Company for the purpose of verifying the identities of your employees and agents in accordance with the CP/CPS. You may designate one or more of your employees or agents (each a "Verifier") to perform these identity verification duties. You acknowledge that you are fully responsible for ensuring that each Verifier complies with the terms of this Agreement and with the requirements of the CP/CPS. You further agree that: (a) you will remove from the role of Verifier any person who ceases to be your employee or agent or who otherwise fails to meet the requirements of this Agreement; (b) Verifiers shall gather, document, and record all identification and authentication materials and data (the "Verification Records") in accordance with this Agreement and the CP/CPS; (c) you shall retain the Verification Records for the period specified in the CP/CPS, even if this period extends beyond the term of this Agreement; (d) you will make any Verification Records requested by Company during the retention period specified in the CP/CPS available to Company within a reasonable timeframe; and (e) you will submit information required by this Agreement to Company only through Company’s secure administrative website or other secure channel in a manner approved by Company. For each person that you verify as Trusted Agent, you attest that sufficient Verification Records exist to substantiate that the identity of that person has been verified in accordance with the requirements of the CP/CPS at the required Level of Assurance. You agree that you shall only grant access to use a Certificate issued to you (or its corresponding private key) to your employees and agents whose identities have been successfully verified at or above the Level of Assurance of such Certificate in accordance with this Agreement, either by Company or by you as Trusted Agent, and that you will terminate such access if a person ceases to be your employee or agent. You acknowledge that failure to provide Verification Records to Company in the timeframe specified by Company and meeting the identity proofing requirements of the CP/CPS, as determined in Company’s sole discretion, may result in immediate revocation of any associated Certificates issued by Company and termination of Trusted Agent status and/or this Agreement.

You acknowledge that if Company receives a complaint from a recipient that you or one of your Authorized Users has sent one or more unsolicited messages, or a request to block transmissions from any Direct address associated with you or your Authorized Users, or if Company determines, in our sole discretion, that you or any of your Authorized Users are using directory information for purposes prohibited by this agreement, Company may impose restrictions upon the associated account or accounts, revoke the associated certificate(s), require you to remove a recipient address from your records, and/or immediately terminate this Agreement.

Requests by an organization or by an Authorized User to opt out of directory listing must be made by an Organizational Representative and submitted through Company’s secure website.
